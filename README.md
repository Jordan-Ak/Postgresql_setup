# Postgresql_setup

I used this repository as an introduction to usin a production-based database Postgresql to the default Sql lite3 used on django.
This repository also serves as a reminder to the settings used to set up postgresql after downloading.

The settings I used with the appropriate comments are located in the "postgretest" folder, settings file, go to line 77 to see the settings I used with appropriate comments.
